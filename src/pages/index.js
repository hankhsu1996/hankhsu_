            <h2>Hi, I'm Shou-Li Hsu</h2>
            <p>
              I'm a student from Taichung, Taiwan. I graduated from National
              Taiwan University with a double major in mechanical engineering
              and electrical engineering. I'm going to attend graduate school in
              the USA.
            </p>
            <p>
              My research interests lie in bio-inspired robots, mmWave
              integrated circuits, and digital integrated circuits. Recently,
              I've been studying microarchitectures, which has become my new
              sweetheart!
            </p>
            <p>
              I have comprehensive capabilities in digital circuits design, with
              past experiences in robot system development and RF circuits
              design as backups.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I like to travel, take photos, and browse design
              works on Pinterest. Sometimes I design my own works, too.

            <h2>What I've Done So Far</h2>
            <p>
              I've engaged in three undergraduate research programs, plus
              several class projects. Here's some of them:
            </p>
            <h3>Gait Development of a Hexapod Robot</h3>
            <p>
              The Hexapod robot has an excellent ability to overcome tough
              terrains; my team aimed to make the robot jump higher. We adapted
              a <i>flip-and-roll</i> gait on the robot so it can jump with a
              higher center of gravity at the beginning.
            </p>
            <h3>Ka-band GaAs IQ Mixer</h3>
            <p>
              This mixer will be used in the receiver system in the{' '}
              <i>Next Generation Very Large Array</i>. It down-converts the
              Ka-band RF signal to 4 - 20 GHz IF signal and achieves a high
              image rejection ratio within the bandwidth. It's been taped-out.
            </p>
            <h3>Advanced Encryption Standard Hardware Accelerator</h3>
            <p>
              It's an ASIC for the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm.
              Taped-out with UMC 0.18 process, this ASIC achieves 300+ times
              faster encryption/decryption than software.
            </p>
            <h3>More Projects</h3>
            <p>
              Only a few larger projects are listed. I've also done some smaller
              yet fun projects; some are class projects and others just for
              interest. For more projects, please{' '}
